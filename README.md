## Overview
This project combines Faster R-CNN, MTCNN, and FaceNet to perform multi-stage object detection and face recognition. The pipeline follows these steps:
1. **Faster R-CNN** detects objects (people and dogs) in an image.
2. **MTCNN** runs only on regions classified as 'people' to detect faces.
3. **FaceNet** encodes and recognizes detected faces against a database of known faces.

## Features
- **Object Detection**: Identifies people and dogs using a fine-tuned Faster R-CNN model.
- **Face Detection**: Uses MTCNN to extract faces from detected 'person' objects.
- **Face Recognition**: Uses FaceNet embeddings to recognize known individuals.
- **Efficient Pipeline**: Runs MTCNN and FaceNet only on relevant regions to improve speed.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/m-nasereslami/FasterRCNN-MTCNN-FaceNet.git
   cd Object-Face-Detection-Recognition
   ```
2. Create and activate a Conda environment with Python 3.9:
   ```bash
   conda create --name face_detection_env python=3.9 -y
   conda activate face_detection_env
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

- [Run the Full Detection Pipeline](hierarchical_detection/) â€“ Perform object detection with Faster R-CNN, apply face detection using MTCNN on detected people, and recognize faces with FaceNet in a sequential pipeline.
- [Encode Faces with FaceNet](encode_faces/) â€“ If you want to generate and use your own face embeddings instead of the existing ones, follow this guide to process and store embeddings for recognition.
- [Train Faster R-CNN](train_faster_rcnn/) â€“ If you want to train the object detection model instead of using the provided pre-trained weights, follow the instructions in this section.
